# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
# - An absolute path is a path starting from the root of the system and provides the full address.
# - A relative path is defines the location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# - Absolute path: cd course_assignments/homework2/
# - Relative path: cd course_assignments and then cd homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# - cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# - It would remove the entries for that directory.

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add

# git commit
# - Commiting our move and looks like a deletion to Git
# git push

# - "git add <file>" saves only the file that you specified.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
# - "git status " tells you the status of your repository.
# - "git log -1" shows you all of the commits in that repository's history.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
# - Cloning a repository creates a complete local copy of a remote Git repository. Pulling from it updates an existing local repository with the latest changes from its remote repository.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
# - So far, the most frustrating error was trying to figure out some of the brackets or quotation marks from some of the homework 1 example. I ran into some issues for some of the questions, so I just changes up some of the quotation marks or brackets until I fixed the issue.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
# - I still have questions on how assignment operators work/what they mean. I am confused on what all the different operations mean.

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
# - I have been to 35 countries!

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(18 // 5) # The // means that it will perform floor division which divides the first number by the second and rounds the result down to nearest whole number. The result is 3 in this case.
