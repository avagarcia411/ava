# -- 4.3 Reducing Data --

# Planet Name: pl_name, planet name most commonly used in the literature, what the planet is commonly called or referred to
# Host Name: hostname, stellar name most commonly used in the literature, the name of the star that the planet orbits
# Discovery Method: discoverymethod, method by which the planet was first identified, how the planet was discovered
# Spectral Type: st_spectype, classification of the star based on their spectral characteristics following the Morgan-Keenan system, the class the star is in based on its surface temperature and determined by the absorbition lines in its spectrum	
# Equilibrium Temperature [K]: pl_eqt, The equilibrium temperature of the planet as modeled by a black body heated only by its host star, or for directly imaged planets, the effective temperature of the planet required to match the measured luminosity if the planet were a black body, when the star is in hydrostatic equilibrium, meaning that the inward force of gravity is balanced with outward pressure
# Planet Mass of Mass*sin(i) [Jupiter Mass]: pl_msinij, Minimum mass of a planet as measured by radial velocity, measured in units of masses of Jupiter, the minimum mass of a planet that is measured in units of masses of Jupiter
