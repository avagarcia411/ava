Topic 1: Neubulas
- Source: spaceplace.nasa.gov (article name: What Is a Nebula?)
- A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space. 
  Some nebulae are from the gas and dust from the explosion of a dying star (like a supernova).
  Others are regions where new stars are formed, and those can be calles "star nurseries."
  Stars form in the nebulae by gravity slowly pulling together clumps of the dust and gas. 
  Those clumps eventually get so big that they collapse from its own gravity, so that forms the beginning of a star!
  Nubulae exist in interstellar space, and the closest one to us is about 700 lys away, the Helix Nebula.
- This source gives all the basic information on nebula to get a basic understanding on the topic.

  Topic 2: Black Holes
- Source: science.nasa.gov (article name: Black Hole Basics)
- Black holes are very large concentrations of matter that is packed into a very tiny space.
  The black hole is so dense that the gravity below the event horizon is so strong that nothing can escape, including light.
  The event horizon is not a surface, it is actually a boundary where all the matter in the black hole is contained
  Black holes are highly studied, but scientists still do not know much about them. 
- This article goes a little bit more in depth compared to the articfle above, it includes basic information on black holes, as well as a video, images, and a infograph that has "Essential Black Hole Facts."

Topic 3: Exoplanets
- Source: science.nasa.gov (article name: Exoplanets)
- An exoplanet is any planet that is not in the solar system. 
  Most orbit stars, but some are untethered to any star.
  There are 6028 confirmed exoplanets.
  Most of those discoveries are from the Milky Way galaxy.
  Scientists have found the compositions of many exoplanets by measuring their sizes and masses.
- This article is very helpful for researching exoplanets and related topics. There are images, videos, and links to many other articles related to the topic.

- I could use Python skills to comb through data regarding exoplanets. I could possibly sort the different exoplanets by size, composition, or distance from earth. I could use loops to, for example, find the closest exoplanet to us who has the composition to possibly have water on its surface.


4. 
- My dream project idea for this topic would be to try and figure out what the compotition of an exoplanet is just based off of some facts I know about it.
- My more simple option could be to create a graph that shows the relationship between different facts about exoplanets, like composition and distance from nearest star.
